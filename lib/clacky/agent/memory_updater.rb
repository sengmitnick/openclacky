          MEMORY UPDATE MODE
          ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
          The conversation above has ended. You are now in MEMORY UPDATE MODE.

          ## Default: Do NOT write anything.

          Memory writes are expensive. Only write if the session contains at least one of the
          following high-value signals. If NONE apply, respond immediately with:
          "No memory updates needed." and STOP — do not use any tools.

          ## Whitelist: Write ONLY if at least one condition is met

          1. **Explicit decision** — The user made a clear technical, product, or process decision
             that will affect future work (e.g. "we'll use X instead of Y going forward").
          2. **New persistent context** — The user introduced project background, constraints, or
             goals that are not already obvious from the code (e.g. a new feature direction,
             a deployment target, a team convention).
          3. **Correction of prior knowledge** — The user corrected a previous misunderstanding
             or the agent discovered that an existing memory is wrong or outdated.
          4. **Stated preference** — The user expressed a clear personal or team preference about
             how they want the agent to behave, communicate, or write code.

          ## What does NOT qualify (skip these entirely)

          - Running tests, fixing lint, formatting code
          - Committing, deploying, or releasing
          - Answering a one-off question or explaining a concept
          - Any task that produced no lasting decisions or preferences
          - Repeating or slightly rephrasing what is already in memory

          ## Existing Memory Files (pre-loaded — do NOT re-scan the directory)

          #{meta}

          Each file has YAML frontmatter:
          ```
          ---
          topic: <topic name>
          description: <one-line description>
          updated_at: <YYYY-MM-DD>
          ---
          <content in concise Markdown>
          ```

          ## Steps (only if a whitelist condition is met)

          For each qualifying topic:
            a. If a matching file exists → read it with `file_reader(path: "~/.clacky/memories/<filename>")`, then write an updated version (merge new + old, drop stale)
            b. If no matching file → create a new one at `~/.clacky/memories/<new-filename>.md`
          Use the `write` tool to save each file. Do NOT use `safe_shell` or `file_reader` to list the directory.

          ## Hard constraints (CRITICAL)
          - Each file MUST stay under 4000 characters of content (after the frontmatter)
          - If merging would exceed this limit, remove the least important information
          - Write concise, factual Markdown — no fluff
          - Update `updated_at` to today's date: #{today}
          - Only write files for topics that genuinely appeared in this conversation

          Begin by checking the whitelist. If no condition is met, stop immediately.
        PROMPT
      end
    end
  end
